	/* Solution explained:

			How's Going Ladies - n - Gentlemen, today we are going to solve one of the coolest problem i.e. Partition Labels
			
			Let's understand what problem statement is,
			
			We have given an string. And we have to divide strings into partition. But here is one condition :-
			
			"Character's are not present beyond it's partition"
			Let's understand with an example,
			
			Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
			Output: [9,7,8]
			
			So, what we'll do now is jump on an charcater and see till where a particular character exists Let's understand it visually:
			
			As you can see we jump over the character a till where it's impacting.
			image
			
			Now we jump over character b till there it's impacting.
			image
			
			Now we jump over character c till there it's impacting.
			image
			
			So as you can see we get one of the partition, as uptill here similar character's are present.
			
			Similarly, we gonna do the same thing for other as well.
			
			image
			
			Now finally, return each partition length in List i.e.[9, 7, 8] :-
			image
			
			Okay, so till now we have understand the problem, now let's talk about it's approach how we gonna solve it:-
			
			Well, i think for that we gonna need the help of HashMap, to solve this problem!! Now you will ask, why HashMap?? I'll say because, we gonna need each & every character index in our hashmap & by that we'll got an indea, from where to partition it.
			
			Still, confuse. Don't worry just walk with me >>
			
			First create an HashMap of Character & Integer [where integer tell us maximum imapct of a character at this index] & after that fill it: Let's look at it visually >
			
			image
			
			Now, we will use one formula in order to solve this.
			So, our formula will be max - prev where max intially is 0 & prev intially is -1
			
			Using the same above example, let's implement it:
			
			Intially we will be at a and in our hashmap we know that a is impacting till 8. So, we will update our max to 8 for now.
			Next we encounter b & it's range is 5. So, it is in the range of 8
			Next we encounter b & it's range is 7. So, it is in the range of 8
			So, there is no more element further in our range, we gonna use our formula :-
			max - prev                                  where max is 8 & prev is -1
			8 - (-1)
			=> 9
			Now we are at d and in our hashmap we know that d is impacting till 14. So, we will update our max to 14 for now & update our previous as well to 8
			Next we encounter e & it's range is 15. So, it is out the range of 14 we gonna update our max to 15
			Next we encounter f & it's range is 11. So, it is in the range of 15
			Next we encounter g & it's range is 13. So, it is in the range of 15
			So, there is no more element further in our range, we gonna use our formula :-
			max - prev                                  where max is 15 & prev is 8
			15 - 8
			=> 7
			Now we are at h and in our hashmap we know that h is impacting till 19. So, we will update our max to 19 for now & update our previous as well to 15
			Next we encounter i & it's range is 22. So, it is out the range of 19 we gonna update our max to 22
			Next we encounter j & it's range is 23. So, it is out the range of 22 we gonna update our max to 23
			Next we encounter k & it's range is 20. So, it is in the range of 23
			Next we encounter l & it's range is 21. So, it is in the range of 23
			So, there is no more element further in our range, we gonna use our formula :-
			max - prev                                  where max is 23 & prev is 15
			23 - 15
			=> 8
			Thus, we add these values to our ArrayList of let's say result & return them i.e. [9, 7, 8]
			
			I hope ladies - n - gentlemen approach is absolute clear, Let's code it up,
